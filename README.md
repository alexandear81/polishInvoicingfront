3.  **Set up Firebase environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Firebase project's configuration:
    ```env
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your_auth_domain"
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"

    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## üì¶ Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment with Firebase Hosting.

1.  **Build the project for production:**
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    This command creates a `dist` folder with the optimized production build.

2.  **Deploy to Firebase:**
    Make sure you have the Firebase CLI installed (`npm install -g firebase-tools`) and are logged in (`firebase login`).
    ```sh
    firebase deploy
    ```
    This will deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to your Firebase project. The `firebase.json` file is already configured for a Single-Page Application (SPA).
